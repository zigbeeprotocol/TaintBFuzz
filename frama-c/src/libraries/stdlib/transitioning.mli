(** This file contains functions available in recent OCaml releases but
    unavailable in the oldest OCaml version officially supported by Frama-C. Be
    sure to update it when support for a given version is dropped.

    Functions are grouped according to the module of the stdlib they
    emulate. The mentioned OCaml version indicate when the function was
    introduced in the stdlib (i.e. when Frama-C requires a version higher
    than that, it can safely be removed from Transitioning).
