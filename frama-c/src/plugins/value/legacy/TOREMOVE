**Function_args**: only there to fill Db.Value.add_formals_to_state, itself used
  by Inout/Cumulative_analysis. [compute_actual] is now in [Transfer_stmt],
  [actualize_formals] is in [Cvalue_transfer]

**Eval_op**: multiple dependencies in Eval_terms and builtins. Must be rewritten
  into the corresponding functionality in Cvalue_forward. This requires having
  contexts for logic terms, though.


To be moved elsewhere, probably in domains/cvalue or in engine:
  eval_annots, eval_terms
