\chapter{Conclusion}

This document presents an Executable ANSI/ISO C Specification Language. It
provides a subset of \acsl~\cite{acsl} implemented~\cite{acslimplem} in the
\framac platform~\cite{framac} in which each construct may be evaluated at
runtime. The specification language described here is intended to evolve in the
future in two directions. First it is based on \acsl which is itself still
evolving. Second the considered subset of \acsl may also change.
