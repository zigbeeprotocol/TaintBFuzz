 * Features :
   # Finallize the generalisation of use of states name instead of their number in the annotated C code generated.
   # Prune the states and transitions in an operation post-condition according to the existence of a path that make it reachable (Using Dijkstra).
   # Add state number in the DOT trace
   
 * BUGS : 
   # Check if a state reached by a transition in a YA property is declared
   # Accept negative constants in properties

 * Feature :
   # Improvement of the YA language : parameters of a function and its return value can now be accessed to describe the property. The syntax is :
      + opName().result to acces the returned value of opName. It implies RETURN(opName).
      + opName().a to acces the a parameter value of opName. It implies CALL(opName).

 * Features :
   # If a state/transition is never reach/crossed, then it is removed from the automata and another pre/post propagation is done.
   # If an operation has no reachable state, then display a message.

 * Feature :
   # Do not generates assumes clause, if there is only one behavior.
