Loop analysis.

* Overview

This plugin tries to compute an upper bound on the number of
iterations in a loop.

* Installation

The installation follows the standard installation of Frama-C
plugins. By default, it is compiled and installed with Frama-C itself.
Otherwise, a manual installation can be performed by typing:

: make

And then, with the sufficient privileges (e.g. as root or using =sudo=):

: make install

* Usage

The analysis of the two parts is triggered using the =-loop= option, for
instance:

: frama-c -loop test.c

The loop analysis path is silent, but its results can be read
programmatically in the =Loop_Max_Iteration= table for use by other
plugins.
