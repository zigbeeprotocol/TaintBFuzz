[kernel] Parsing shifts.c (with preprocessing)
[eva] Analyzing a complete application starting at main
[eva] Computing initial state
[eva] Initial state computed
[eva:initial-state] Values of globals at initialization
  e ∈ {0}
[eva] computing for function f <- main.
  Called from shifts.c:19.
[eva] shifts.c:13: assertion got status valid.
[eva] shifts.c:8: function f, behavior a: postcondition got status valid.
[eva] shifts.c:9: function f, behavior b: postcondition got status valid.
[eva] Recording results for f
[eva] Done for function f
[eva] Recording results for main
[eva] done for function main
[eva] ====== VALUES COMPUTED ======
[eva:final-states] Values at end of function f:
  e ∈ {168}
  y ∈ {168}
[eva:final-states] Values at end of function main:

  __retres ∈ {0}
[from] Computing for function f
[from] Done for function f
[from] Computing for function main
[from] Done for function main
[from] ====== DEPENDENCIES COMPUTED ======
  These dependencies hold at termination for the executions that terminate:
[from] Function f:
  e FROM x
  \result FROM x
[from] Function main:
  e FROM \nothing
  \result FROM \nothing
[from] ====== END OF DEPENDENCIES ======
