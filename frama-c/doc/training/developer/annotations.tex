\begin{frame}[fragile]{Accessing Annotations}

\begin{itemize}
\item do not read annotations directly stored in the AST
\item global annotations: \lstinline+Globals.Annotations+
\item function contracts: \lstinline+Kernel_function.get_spec+
\item code annotations: \lstinline+Annotations+
\item visitor

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Generating Annotations}

\begin{itemize}
\item do not modify AST nodes in place
\item copy visitor
\item global annotation: \lstinline+Globals.Annotations.add_generated+
\item function contract: \lstinline+Kernel_function.set_spec+
\item code annotation: \lstinline+Annotations.add+, 
\lstinline+Annotations.add_assert+
\begin{itemize}
\item require a list of states in argument
\item they are the states which the generation of the annotation depends on
\end{itemize}
\begin{ocamlcode}
let value_alarm = ... in

\begin{frame}{Upcoming Annotations}

\begin{itemize}
\item \framac Oxygen provides a fully new API for annotations
\item global annotations, function contracts and code annotations in a single
  module \lstinline+Annotations+
\item new consistent and uniform interface
\item no more states in argument for code annotations
\item but a so-called \emph{emitter} for any new annotation
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Property Statuses}
\framesubtitle{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item each plug-in may emit a (local) status for a property $p$, that is
  whether $p$ is valid or invalid
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ``valid'' means: for each execution trace from the beginning on the
    application to $p$, $p$ is  logically valid
  \item ``invalid'' is the opposite of ``valid''
  \item plug-ins must be correct: it cannot says that $p$ is valid
    if it is not (and conversely).
  \end{itemize}
\item the kernel automatically consolidates the result for each property
  according to all emitted statuses
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{From Annotations to Properties}
  \framesubtitle{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item ACSL annotations may contain several properties (for instance, behaviors)
\item module \lstinline+Property+ defines properties as a single datatype
\item it also provides operations to convert an annotation to a propertie or a
  set of properties
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Emitters}

\begin{itemize}
\item emitters emit property statuses according to parameters
\item if a correctness parameter changes, then valid statuses may become invalid
  (or conversely)
\item if a tuning parameter changes, then only unknown statuses may be refined
  into valid or invalid.
\end{itemize}

\begin{ocamlcode}
let emitter = 
  Emitter.create
    "my_emitter"

\framesubtitle{Reachability}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``$p$ is invalid'' means: it exists an execution trace from the beginning
  on the application to $p$ such that $p$ is logically invalid.
\item require a proof of reachability and a proof of invalidity
\item may be difficult
\item 2 different local statuses: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline+False_and_reachable+
  \item \lstinline+False_if_reachable+ which automatically adds an hypothesis
    about reachability of $p$.
