\subsection{Overview}

\begin{frame}{Project Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item \framac may handle several ASTs in the same session
\item a project groups together one AST with all the global data attached to it
\item examples of such data are
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the AST itself
  \item kernel tables like those of kernel functions and annotations
  \item command line options
  \item results of analyzers
  \end{itemize}
\item such data are called states
\item by default, each operation are applied on the current project
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Client/Server View}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item delayed synchronization between client $i$ and server' state $i$
    of the current project    
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{State}

\begin{frame}{State}
  \framesubtitle{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item each time you create a global data, ask yourself: "is this data part of a
  project or common to all projects?"
\item most often, it is really part of a project
\item in such cases, you have to create a \emph{projectified state} (otherwise
  use standard \ocaml datastructures like references or hashtables)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{State}
  \framesubtitle{Registration Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item module \lstinline+State_builder+
\item a state is a module created through functor application
\item low-level functor \lstinline+State_builder.Register+
\item several high-level functors
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline+State_builder.Ref+
  \item \lstinline+State_builder.Option_ref+
  \item \lstinline+State_builder.Set_ref+
  \item \lstinline+State_builder.Hashtbl+
  \item \lstinline+State_builder.Queue+
  \item \lstinline+State_builder.Counter+
  \item ...
  \end{itemize}
\item much simpler to use them (prefer a reference to a record than a mutable
  record, even if less efficient...)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Selection}

\begin{frame}{State Selection}
  \framesubtitle{Overview}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item project operations may be applied only on some states
  \item such a set of states is called a \emph{state selection}
  \item a way to improve efficiency
  \item a way to easily implement some operations over states (like clearing)
  \item must preserve \framac's global consistency
  \item that is the \emph{raison d'\^etre} of \emph{state dependencies} which
    allows to easily specify consistent selections
  \end{itemize}
