\chapter{Preparing the Sources}
\label{user-sources}

This chapter explains how to specify the source files that form the
basis of an analysis project, and describes options that influence parsing.

\section{Overview of source processing in \FramaC}\label{sec:overview}

For small projects and tests, processing the sources in \FramaC is as simple
as running \texttt{frama-c *.c}. For more complex projects, however,
some problems may arise when using this command, and the user must be aware
of the several steps involved in \FramaC source processing to fix them.

The diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:source-preparation} presents an overview
of the steps described in this chapter. For comparison purposes, we add
the equivalent process performed by a compiler such as GCC.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{source-preparation.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of source preparation steps: as performed by GCC
      (top) and as performed by \FramaC (bottom).}
    \label{fig:source-preparation}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The following sections describe various options related to the steps shown
in the figure. Note that some plug-ins, such as \textsf{Variadic}
(described in chapter~\ref{user-variadic}), perform further AST
transformations before most analyses are run.

\section{Preprocessing the Source Files}\label{sec:preprocessing}

The list of files to analyze must be provided on the command line, or
chosen interactively in the GUI. Files with the suffix
{\tt .i} are assumed to be already preprocessed \C files. \FramaC
preprocesses {\tt .c} and {\tt .h} files with the following basic command:
\begin{shell}
\$ gcc -C -E -I .
\end{shell}
Plus some architecture-dependent flags. The {\em exact} preprocessing command
line can be obtained via options \texttt{-kernel-msg-key pp} and
\optiondef{-}{print-cpp-commands} (the latter exits \FramaC after printing).

Option \optiondef{-}{cpp-extra-args} can be used to add arguments to the
default preprocessing command, typically via the inclusion of defines
(\texttt{-D} switches) and header directories (\texttt{-I} switches), as in
\texttt{-cpp-extra-args="-DDEBUG -DARCH=ia32 -I./headers"}.
You can also add arguments on a per-file basis, using option
\optiondef{-}{cpp-extra-args-per-file}.

If you need to, you can also {\em replace} the preprocessing command
entirely with option \optiondef{-}{cpp-command}. Placeholders (see below)
can be used for advanced commands.
If no placeholders are used, the preprocessor is invoked in the
following way.
\begin{commands}
\texttt{<cmd> <args> <input file> -o <output file>}
\end{commands}

In this command, \texttt{<output file>} is a temporary filename chosen by
\FramaC while \texttt{<input file>} is one of the filenames provided by the
user.

For commands which do not follow this pattern, it is also possible to use
the following placeholders:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\texttt{\%input}, \texttt{\%i} or \texttt{\%1} & Input file \\
\hline
\texttt{\%output}, \texttt{\%o} or \texttt{\%2} & Output file \\
\hline
\texttt{\%args} & Additional arguments (see \texttt{-cpp-extra-args} below)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Here are some examples for using this option.
\begin{shell}
\$ frama-c -cpp-command 'gcc -C -E -I. -x c' file1.src file2.i
\$ frama-c -cpp-command 'gcc -C -E -I. %args -o %o %i' file1.c file2.i
\$ frama-c -cpp-command 'cp %i %o'  file1.c file2.i
\$ frama-c -cpp-command 'cat %i > %o' file1.c file2.i
\$ frama-c -cpp-command 'CL.exe /C /E %args %i > %o' file1.c file2.i
\end{shell}

When using \optionuse{-}{cpp-command}, you may add \optiondef{-}{cpp-frama-c-compliant}
to indicate that the custom preprocessor accepts the same set of options as GNU
\texttt{cpp}.
\optionuse{-}{cpp-frama-c-compliant} also implies some extra
constraints, such as accepting architecture-specific flags, e.g. \texttt{-m32}.

If you have a JSON compilation database file\footnote{%
  \url{http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html}}, you can use
it to retrieve preprocessing macros such as \texttt{-D} and \texttt{-I}
for each file in the database, via option
\optiondef{-}{json-compilation-database} \texttt{<path>}, where \texttt{<path>}
is the path to the JSON file or to a directory containing a
file named \texttt{compile\_commands.json}. With this option set,
\FramaC will parse
the compilation database and include associated preprocessing flags,
as if they had been manually added via \texttt{-cpp-extra-args-per-file}.
Note: if both \texttt{-cpp-extra-args-per-file} and the JSON compilation
database specify options for a given file, the former are used and the latter
are ignored. Also note that the use of the database simply adds flags
{\em for the files specified on the command-line}, but these files must still
be specified by the user.

In all of the above cases,
\acsl annotations are preprocessed by default (option \optiondef{-}{pp-annot}
is set by default). Unless a custom preprocessor is specified
(via \optionuse{-}{cpp-frama-c-compliant}), \FramaC considers that \gcc is
installed and uses it as preprocessor.
If you do \emph{not} want annotations to be preprocessed, you need to pass
option \texttt{-no-pp-annot} to \FramaC. Note that some headers in the
standard C library provided with \FramaC (described in Section~\ref{sec:libc})
use such annotations,
therefore it might be necessary to disable inclusion of such headers.

Also note that ACSL annotations are preprocessed separately from the C
code in a second pass, and that arguments given as \texttt{-cpp-extra-args} are
\emph{not} given to the second pass of preprocessing. Instead,
\texttt{-pp-annot} relies on the ability of \gcc to output all
macro definitions (including those given with \texttt{-D}) in the
preprocessed file. In particular, \texttt{-cpp-extra-args} must be
used if you are including header files who behave differently
depending on the number of times they are included.

In addition, files having the suffix \texttt{.ci} will be considered as needing
preprocessing for ACSL annotations only. Those files may contain
\texttt{\#define} directives and annotations are preprocessed as explained in
the previous paragraph. This allows to have macros in ACSL annotations while
using a non-GNU-like preprocessor.

\section{Merging the Source Code files}

After preprocessing, \FramaC parses, type-checks and links the source
code.  It also performs these operations for the \acsl annotations
optionally present in the program. Together, these steps form the
\emph{merging} phase of the creation of an analysis project.

\FramaC aborts whenever any error occurs during one of these steps. However
users can use the option
\texttt{-kernel-warn-key annot-error=active}\footnote{%
See section~\ref{sec:feedback-options} for more information on warning statuses.}
in order to
continue after emitting a warning when an \acsl annotation fails to type-check.

\section{Normalizing the Source Code}\label{sec:normalize}

After merging the project files, \FramaC performs
a number of local code transformations in the \emph{normalization} phase.
These transformations aim at making further work easier for the analyzers.
% VP: exclusively -> usually: it's not forbidden for a plugin to work on Cabs.
Analyses usually take place on the normalized version of the source code.
The normalized version may be printed by using
the option \optionuse{-}{print} (see Section~\ref{sec:io}).

Normalization gives a program which is semantically equivalent to the
original one, except for one point. Namely, when the specification of
a function \texttt{f} that is only declared and has no ACSL
\texttt{assigns} clause is required by some analysis, \FramaC
generates an \texttt{assigns} clause based on the prototype of
\texttt{f} (the form of this clause is left unspecified). Indeed, as
mentioned in the ACSL manual~\cite{acsl}, assuming that \texttt{f} can
write to any location in the memory would amount to stop any
semantical analysis at the first call to \texttt{f}, since nothing
would be known on the memory state afterwards. \emph{The user is
  invited to check that the generated clause makes sense}, and to
provide an explicit \texttt{assigns} clause if this is not the case.

The following options allow to customize the normalization process.
\begin{description}
\item \optiondef{-}{aggressive-merging} forces some function
  definitions to be merged into a single function if they are equal
  modulo renaming. Note that this option may merge two functions even
  if their original source code is different but their normalized
  version coincides. This option is mostly useful to share function
  definitions that stem from headers included by several source files.

\item \optiondef{-}{allow-duplication} allows the duplication of small
  blocks of code during normalization of loops and tests. This is set
  by default and the option is mainly found in its opposite form,
 \texttt{-no-allow-duplication} which forces \FramaC to use labels and
 gotos instead. Note that bigger blocks and blocks with a non-trivial
 control flow are never duplicated. Option \optionuse{-}{ulevel} (see
 below) is not affected by this option and always duplicates the loop body.

\item \optiondef{-}{annot} forces \FramaC to interpret \acsl annotations.
This option is set by default, and is only found in its opposite form
\texttt{-no-annot}, which prevents interpretation of
\acsl annotations.

\item \optiondef{-}{asm-contracts} tells \FramaC to generate \lstinline|assigns|
clauses for inline \lstinline|asm| statements using extended GNU notation
with output and input operands. This option is set by default, and opposite form
\texttt{-no-asm-contracts} prevents the generation of such clauses.
If the assembly block
already has a statement contract which is not guarded by a \lstinline|for b:|
clause \lstinline|assigns| clauses are generated only for behaviors which do not
already have one.

\item \optiondef{-}{asm-contracts-auto-validate} tells \FramaC to
automatically mark as valid \lstinline|assigns| clauses generated from
\lstinline|asm| statements. However, if an \lstinline|asm| statement contains
\lstinline|memory| in its clobber list, the corresponding clause will \emph{not}
be considered valid through this option.

\item \optiondef{-}{collapse-call-cast} allows, in some cases,
the value returned by
a function call to be implicitly cast to the type of the value it is
assigned to (if such a conversion is authorized by the C
standard). Otherwise, a temporary variable separates the call and the
cast. The default is to have implicit casts for function calls, so the
opposite form \texttt{-no-collapse-call-cast} is more useful.

\item \optiondef{-}{constfold} performs a syntactic folding of
constant expressions. For instance,
the expression \texttt{1+2} is replaced by \texttt{3}.

\item \deprecatedoptiondef{-}{continue-annot-error} \emph{Deprecated option.}
  Just emits a warning and discards the annotation when it fails to type-check,
  instead of generating an error (errors in \C are still fatal). This behavior
  is now managed by warning category (Section~\ref{sec:feedback-options})
\texttt{annot-error}, whose default status is ``abort''. Behavior of
\texttt{-continue-annot-error} can thus be obtained with
\texttt{-kernel-warn-key annot-error=active}, or even
\texttt{-kernel-warn-key annot-error=inactive} to silently ignore any ill-formed
annotations.

\item \texttt{\optiondef{-}{enums} <repr name>} specifies which representation
should be used for a given enumerated type. Namely, the C standard allows the use
of any integral type in which all the corresponding tags can be represented.
Default is \texttt{gcc-enums}. A list of supported
options can be obtained by typing:
\begin{shell}
\$ frama-c -enums help
\end{shell}
This includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{int}: treat everything as \texttt{int} (including enumerated types
with \texttt{packed} attribute).
\item \texttt{gcc-enums}: use an unsigned integer type when no tag has a
negative value, and choose the smallest rank possible starting from \texttt{int}
(default \gcc's behavior)
\item \texttt{gcc-short-enums}: use an unsigned integer type when no tag has
a negative value, and choose the smallest rank possible starting from
\texttt{char} (\gcc's \texttt{-fshortenums} option)
\end{itemize}

\item \optiondef{-}{initialized-padding-locals} forces to initialize padding
  bits of locals to 0. If false, padding bits are left uninitialized. This
  option is set by default.

\item \texttt{\optiondef{-}{inline-calls} <f1,...,fn>} inlines calls to
  functions. Use \texttt{@inline} to select all functions with attribute
  \texttt{inline}.
  For recursive functions, only the first level
  is inlined (e.g., the function will contain an inlined version of itself with
  a recursive call inside it). Calls via function pointers are ignored.

\item \texttt{\optiondef{-}{remove-inlined} <f1,...,fn>} removes from the AST
  functions \texttt{f1,...,fn}, which must have been given to
  \optionuse{-}{inline-calls}. Note: this option does not check if the given
  functions were fully inlined.

\item \optiondef{-}{keep-switch} preserves \texttt{switch} statements in the
  source code. Without this option, they are transformed into \texttt{if}
  statements. An experimental plug-in may require this option to be unset
  to avoid having to handle the \texttt{switch} construct.
  Other plug-ins may prefer this option to be used because it better
  preserves the structure of the original program.

\item \optiondef{-}{keep-unused-specified-functions} does not remove from the
  AST uncalled function prototypes that have ACSL contracts. This option is
  set by default. So you mostly use the opposite form, namely
  \optiondef{-}{remove-unused-specified-functions}.

\item \optiondef{-}{keep-unused-types} does not remove unused types and
  enum/struct/union declarations. By default, such types are removed,
  that is, its opposite option \optiondef{-}{remove-unused-types} is set.

\item \texttt{\optiondef{-}{machdep} <machine architecture name>} defines the
  target platform. The default value is a \texttt{x86\_64} bits
  platform. Analyzers may take into account the \emph{endianness} of the
  target, the size and alignment of elementary data types, and other
  architecture/compilation parameters. The \texttt{-machdep} option provides a
  way to define all these parameters consistently in a single step.
  Note that multiarch preprocessors such as GCC's may require special flags
  to ensure compatibility with the chosen machdep, e.g. \texttt{-m32} for a
  \texttt{x86\_64} GCC compiling 32-bit code. In most cases this is handled
  automatically, but otherwise option \optionuse{-}{cpp-command} can be used.

The list of supported platforms can be obtained by typing:
\begin{shell}
\$ frama-c -machdep help
\end{shell}

The process for adding a new platform is described in the Plug-in
Development Guide~\cite{plugin-dev-guide}.

\item \optiondef{-}{simplify-cfg} allows \FramaC to remove break, continue and
  switch statements. This option is automatically set by some plug-ins that
  cannot handle these kinds of statements. This option is off by default.

\item \optiondef{-}{simplify-trivial-loops} simplifies trivial loops such as
  \texttt{do ... while(0)}. This option is set by default.

\item \texttt{\optiondef{-}{ulevel} <n>} unrolls all loops n times. This is a
  purely syntactic operation.  Loops can be unrolled individually, by
  inserting the \pragmadef{UNROLL} pragma just before the loop statement. Do
  not confuse this option with plug-in-specific options that may also be called
  ``unrolling''~\cite{value}. Below is a typical example of use.
\begin{ccode}
/*@ loop pragma UNROLL 10; */
for(i = 0; i < 9; i++) ...
\end{ccode}
The transformation introduces an \pragmadef{UNROLL} pragma indicating that the unrolling process has been done:
\begin{ccode}
... // loop unrolled 10 times
/*@ loop pragma UNROLL 10;
    loop pragma UNROLL "done", 10; */
  ... // remaining loop
\end{ccode}
That allows to disable unrolling transformation on such a loop when reusing \FramaC with a code obtained by a previous use of \FramaC tool.
To ignore this disabling \pragmadef{UNROLL} pragma and force unrolling, the option \texttt{\optiondef{-}{ulevel-force}} has to be set.

Passing a negative argument to \texttt{-ulevel} will disable unrolling, even
in case of \texttt{UNROLL} pragma.

\item \optiondef{-}{c11} allows the use of some C11 constructs. Currently
supported are typedefs redefinition.
\end{description}

\section{Predefined macros}\label{sec:predefined-macros}

\FramaC, like several compilers and code analysis tools, predefines and uses
a certain number of C macros. They are summarized below.

\begin{description}
\item \textttdef{\_\_FRAMAC\_\_}: defined to 1 during preprocessing by \FramaC,
as if the user had added \texttt{-D\_\_FRAMAC\_\_} to the command line. Useful
for conditional compilation and detection of an execution by \FramaC.

\item \textttdef{\_\_FC\_MACHDEP\_{\em XXX}}, where \texttt{{\em XXX}} is one of
  \texttt{X86\_16}, \texttt{X86\_32}, \texttt{X86\_64}, \texttt{PPC\_32} or
  \texttt{MSVC\_X86\_64}:
according to the option \optionuse{-}{machdep} chosen by the user,
the corresponding macro is predefined by \FramaC. Those macros correspond to
the values of \texttt{-machdep} that are built-in in the Frama-C kernel.
In addition, custom machdeps can be added
by plug-ins or scripts. If such a machdep named \texttt{custom-name}
is selected, \FramaC will predefine the macro
\texttt{\_\_FC\_MACHDEP\_CUSTOM\_NAME}, that is the upper-case version of the
name of the machdep.
Conversely, if an
\texttt{\_\_FC\_MACHDEP\_{\em XXX}} macro is defined by the user in
\texttt{-cpp-command} or \texttt{-cpp-extra-args}, then \FramaC
will consider it as a custom machdep and will {\em not} add any machdep-related
macros. It is then the responsibility of the user to ensure that
\texttt{-machdep} and \texttt{\_\_FC\_MACHDEP\_{\em XXX}} are coherent.

\item \textttdef{\_\_FC\_*}: macros prefixed by \texttt{\_\_FC\_} are reserved
  by \FramaC and should not be defined by the user (except for custom machdeps,
  as mentioned above, and for customization macros, as described below).
These include machdep-related macros and definitions
related to \FramaC's standard library.
\end{description}

Furthermore, some macros are undefined in the standard library, and can
be defined (e.g. through \lstinline|-cpp-extra-args|) to customize the \FramaC
standard library. They are described below.

\begin{description}
\item \textttdef{\_\_FC\_NO\_MONOTONIC\_CLOCK}: By default, \FramaC defines
  a \lstinline|MONOTONIC_CLOCK| in \lstinline|time.h|. If this macro is defined,
  this clock is not available.
\item \textttdef{\_\_FC\_INDETERMINABLE\_FLOATS}: By default, \FramaC's libc
  uses an IEEE-754 compatible environment. If this macro is defined,
  rounding mode and float evaluation
  (macros \lstinline|FLT_ROUNDS| and \lstinline|FLT_EVAL_METHOD|) will be
  considered as indeterminable.

\end{description}

\section{Compiler and language extensions}\label{sec:extensions}

\FramaC's default behavior is to be fairly strict concerning language features.
By default, most non-C99 compiler extensions are not accepted, similarly to
when compiling a program with \verb+gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -pedantic-errors+.

However, depending on the machine architecture (see option
\optiondef{-}{machdep}, in Section~\ref{sec:normalize}),
\FramaC accepts some compiler extensions, namely for GCC and MSVC machdeps.
For instance, trying to parse a program containing an empty initializer,
such as \verb+int c[10] = {};+ will result in the following error message:

\begin{verbatim}
[kernel] user error: empty initializers only allowed for GCC/MSVC
\end{verbatim}

This means that using a GCC or MSVC machdep (e.g., \verb+-machdep gcc_x86_32+)
will allow the language extension to be accepted by \FramaC.

Alternatively, some C11 extensions are supported via option \verb+-c11+.
For instance, the following program is invalid in C99 but valid in C11
(typedef redefinition): \lstinline|typedef int a; typedef int a;|

The error message given by \FramaC when trying to parse this program will
indicate the option needed to allow the file to be parsed:

\begin{verbatim}
[kernel] user error: redefinition of type 'a' in the same scope is only
         allowed in C11 (option -c11).
\end{verbatim}

\section{Standard library (libc)}\label{sec:libc}

\FramaC bundles a C standard library in order to help parse and analyze code
that relies on the functions specified in the ISO C standard.
Furthermore, In order to simplify parsing of code using common open-source libraries,
\FramaC's standard library also includes some POSIX and non-POSIX headers which
are not part of ISO C.
Such libraries are provided on a best-effort basis, and they are part of the
{\em trusted computing base}: to ensure its correctness, the specifications
must be ultimately proofread by the user.

This library, while incomplete, is constantly being improved and extended.
It is installed in the sub-directory \texttt{libc} of the directory printed by
\texttt{frama-c -print-share-path}. It contains standard \C headers,
some \acsl specifications, and definitions for a few library functions.

By default, \FramaC's preprocessing will include the headers of its own standard
library, instead of those installed in the user's machine. This avoids issues
with non-portable, compiler-specific features.
Option \optiondef{-}{frama-c-stdlib} (set by default)
adds \texttt{-I\$FRAMAC\_SHARE/libc} to the preprocessor command, as well as
GCC-specific option \texttt{-nostdinc}. If the latter is not recognized by
your preprocessor,
\optionuse{-}{no-cpp-frama-c-compliant} can be given to \FramaC
(see section~\ref{sec:preprocessing}).

The use of \FramaC's standard library contains a few caveats:
\begin{itemize}
\item definitions which are not present in \FramaC's standard library may cause
  parsing errors, e.g. missing type definitions, or missing fields in structs;
\item if a header is included which is not available in \FramaC's library,
  preprocessing will fail by default (due to the \texttt{-nostdinc} option);
  if the user manually includes the system's library, e.g. by adding
  \texttt{-cpp-extra-args='-I/usr/include'}, the preprocessor will end up
  mixing headers from \FramaC's library with those from the system, often
  leading to incompatible definitions and unexpected parsing errors.
  In this case, the best approach is usually to include {\em only} the missing
  definitions, for instance by copying them to a separate header file, included
  manually or via the GCC-compatible option \texttt{-include <header.h>}
  (see {\em GCC's Preprocessor Options} for more details). Alternatively,
  consider filing an issue (see Chapter~\ref{user-errors}) to ask for the
  inclusion of such headers and/or definitions in \FramaC's standard library.
\end{itemize}

Note that, while \FramaC's library intends to offer maximum portability, some
definitions such as numeric constants require actual values to be defined.
For pragmatic reasons, such definitions are most often based on the values
defined in GNU/Linux's libc, and may differ from those in your system.
As stated before, if you want to ensure the code analyzed by \FramaC is
strictly equivalent to the one from the target system, you must either
proofread the definitions, or provide your own library files.

\section{Warnings during normalization}\label{sec:warnings-normalize}

\emph{Note: the options below are deprecated, replaced by the more general and
  flexible mechanism of \emph{warning categories}, described in
  Section~\ref{sec:feedback-options}.}

Some options can be used to influence the warnings that are
emitted by \FramaC during the normalization phase.

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{\deprecatedoptiondef{-}{warn-decimal-float} <freq>}
  (\emph{deprecated}) warns
  when floating-point constants in the program cannot be exactly represented;
  freq must be one of \texttt{none}, \texttt{once} or \texttt{all}.
  Defaults to \texttt{once}.
  \emph{Superseded by warning category \texttt{parser:decimal-float}.}

\item \texttt{\deprecatedoptiondef{-}{implicit-function-declaration} <action>}
  (\emph{deprecated}) defines
  the action to perform (\texttt{ignore}, \texttt{warn} or \texttt{error})
  whenever a call to a function that has not been previously declared is found.
  This is invalid in C90 or in C99, but could be valid K\&R code.
  Defaults to \texttt{warn}.
  \emph{Superseded by warning category \texttt{typing:implicit-function-declaration}}.
  \textbf{Note:} parsing is not guaranteed to succeed, regardless of
  the emission of the warning. Upon encountering a call to an undeclared
  function, \FramaC attempts to continue its parsing
  phase by inferring a prototype corresponding to the type of the
  arguments at the call (modulo default argument promotions).
  If the real declaration does not match the
  inferred prototype, parsing will later end with an error.
\end{description}

\section{Testing the Source Code Preparation}

If the steps up to normalization succeed, the project is then ready for
analysis by any \FramaC plug-in. It is possible to test that the source code
preparation itself succeeds, by running \FramaC without any option.
\begin{shell}
\$ frama-c <input files>
\end{shell}

If you need to use other options for preprocessing or normalizing the source
code, you can use the option \optiondef{-}{typecheck} for
the same purpose. For instance:
\begin{shell}
frama-c -cpp-command 'gcc -C -E -I. -x c' -typecheck file1.src file2.i
\end{shell}


% Local variables:
% mode: TeX
% TeX-master: "userman.tex"
% ispell-local-dictionary: "english"
% End:
