\FramaC provides sound analyses for several kinds of code defects.
Given the large amount of covered defects and command-line options which
toggle their reporting, we provide in this chapter information about standards
compliance, coding guidelines and related documents, such as the ISO C standard,
CWEs, CERT C, etc.

This chapter is not exhaustive; in particular, some defects are implicitly
checked without any controlling options; others may be affected by
a combination of several options which is hard to precisely express.

Please contact the \FramaC team if you require a thorough evaluation of the
standards cited here, or of different ones. This reference is provided on a
best-effort basis.

\section{Frama-C Options Related to C Undefined Behaviors}

This section lists several \FramaC options affecting (either enabling or
disabling) the detection of {\em unspecified} and {\em undefined} behaviors
listed in Annexes J.1 and J.2 of the C11 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2011).

Note: the ISO C standard does not provide an identifier for each behavior;
therefore, we use the numbers listed in
{\em SEI CERT C Coding Standard's Back Matter}, sections
{\em CC. Undefined Behavior} and {\em DD. Unspecified Behavior}, whenever
possible. These tables can be found at
\url{https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c}.
Note that SEI CERT does not list implementation-defined behaviors; in such
cases, we simply refer to the related section in the ISO C standard.

\section{RTE categories and C Undefined Behaviors}

This section presents the correspondence between runtime execution (RTE) alarms
emitted by the Eva plugin and C undefined behaviors.

  This category comprises the following RTEs:
  \texttt{signed\_overflow}, \texttt{unsigned\_overflow},

  (mostly related to {\em CC.36}), and

\end{longtable}

Note that some undefined behaviors,
such as {\em CC.100}, {\em CC.191}, {\em CC.192} and others,
are not handled by specific categories of RTEs, but instead by ACSL
specifications in \FramaC's libc. These specifications are used by some
analyzers and result in warnings and errors when violated.

\paragraph{Note about \texttt{ptrdiff\_t}}
          {\em CC.50} deals with pointer subtractions, related to type \texttt{ptrdiff\_t}.
          \FramaC does not perform specific handling for this type,
          but in all standard machdeps defined in \FramaC, its definition
          is such that pointer subtraction will lead to a signed overflow
          if the difference cannot be represented in \texttt{ptrdiff\_t},
          thus preventing the undefined behavior. However, if option
          \texttt{-no-warn-signed-overflow} is used, or in a custom machdep,
          this may not hold.

\section{C Undefined Behaviors {\em not} handled by \FramaC}

This section lists some of the C undefined behaviors which are currently
{\em not} directly covered by the open-source version of \FramaC.

The list includes UBs which are delegated to other tools, such as the
preprocessor or the compiler.
\FramaC does not preprocess the sources, relying on external
preprocessors such as GCC's or Clang; therefore, related UBs are out of the
scope of \FramaC and listed below, even though in practice they are verified
by the underlying preprocessor in all but the most exotic architectures.

For a few UBs of syntactic nature, which are always detected during compilation,
\FramaC delegates the task to the compiler. This implies that, when running
\FramaC directly on the code, it may not complain about them; but the code
will generate an error during compilation anyway, {\em without} requiring
specific compilation flags.

This list is not exhaustive; in particular, some UBs not listed here are
partially handled by \FramaC. Please contact the \FramaC team if you would like
more information about whether a specific set of UBs is handled by the platform.

\section{Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) Reported and not Reported by Frama-C}

This section lists some CWEs handled by \FramaC, as well as some
which are currently out of the scope of \FramaC's default plugins. The latter
may be handled by specialized analyses, such as plugins not currently
distributed with the open-source release of \FramaC, or in future evolutions
of the \FramaC platform.

Note that, due to the large amount of existing CWEs, and the fact that mapping
them to undefined behaviors is not always straightforward, there are likely
several other CWEs which are already handled by \FramaC, at least in some
contexts.
Please contact the \FramaC team if you would like more information about whether
a specific set of CWEs is handled by some analysis in the platform.

Remark: this section is partially based on work related to
NIST's Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation
(SAMATE\footnote{\url{https://samate.nist.gov/Main_Page.html}}),
namely its Static Analysis Tool Expositions (SATE),
which allowed us to identify some of the CWEs which
\FramaC already can or cannot handle. The CWEs listed here are mostly those
present in Juliet's 1.3 C/C++ test suite, available at NIST SAMATE's website.
Several caveats apply; for instance, some Juliet tests marked as {\em bad}
(that is, exhibiting a weakness) only do so for specific architectural
configurations, e.g. 32-bit pointers. If \FramaC is run with a different
\texttt{machdep}, the test may not exhibit any undefined behavior, as
the weakeness is not actually present for such architectures.
A rigorous assessment of such situations is necessary for strong claims of
soundness.

In Table~\ref{tab:cwe}, the {\em Status} column summarizes the current
handling of the CWE by \FramaC, as one of the following:

\begin{description}
\item[Handled] means \FramaC already handles the CWE; in some cases, its
  detection may be controlled by command-line options;
\item[Partially Handled] means the CWE is handled only in some specific cases;
  \FramaC can thus help {\em detect} occurrences of this CWE, but not
  {\em prove their absence};
\item[Annotations] means the CWE could be handled by \FramaC, but some
  development is required; in practice, this often means user annotations
  will be required, e.g. for specifying the source of tainted data;
  this often implies adding a new abstract domain to Eva, or modifying the
  analyzer to propagate the data provided by the annotations;
\item[Syntactic] means the CWE is of a syntactic nature, while \FramaC
  specializes in semantic analyses; it is currently not handled by \FramaC
  and could probably be so, if a user required it; but it is not the primary
  concern of the platform developers.
\item[Too Vague] means the CWE is either too vague or too broad to be formally
  matched to a given set of properties that \FramaC can verify.

\paragraph{Note about {\em Numerical Conversions}}

A few CWEs (\CWE{194}, \CWE{195}, \CWE{196} and \CWE{197}) related to numerical
conversion issues do not map directly to undefined behaviors
(except, in some cases, to {\em CC.36});
some of them are related to unspecified and implementation-defined behaviors.
\FramaC has a set of command-line options to enable warnings related to these
conversions, when they can overflow or generate unexpected values:
\texttt{-warn-signed-overflow}, \texttt{-warn-unsigned-overflow},
\texttt{-warn-signed-downcast}, and \texttt{-warn-unsigned-downcast}.

See Section~\ref{sec:customizing-analyzers} for more details and some examples
related to these options.

Also note that conversion from a floating-point value to an integer may
overflow; in this case, an alarm \texttt{float\_to\_int} is generated,
independently of the previous options.
