# Makefile Targets

The most useful development targets are:

```
$ make tsc   # run linter
$ make dev   # run development version
$ make app   # build production version
$ make dist  # package the application
$ make doc   # generate the documentation
$ make api   # update the frama-c server API
```

Additional makefile targets and environment variables are listed by:

```
$ make dome-help
```

# Emacs Configuration

Emacs mode configuration can be setup with Typescript, Web-mode and Tide packages.
You can install them with `M-x package-install`:

```
M-x package-refresh-contents ;; updates your index
M-x package-install web-mode
M-x package-install typescript-mode
M-x package-install tide
```

For configuring your `.emacs` accordingly,
please look at the `ivette/src/dome/template/typescript.el` file.
It setup the Tide package to work with
`typescript-mode` for `*.ts` files (see also `tsfmt.json` config file)
and `web-mode` for `*.tsx` files.

Useful commands:

```
M-. goto definition
M-, back to previous point
M-x tide-documentation-at-point
M-x tide-error-at-point
```

# VS Code

VS Code has native support for Typescript (and JavaScript, of course), in terms
of code navigation, syntax highlighting and formatting, compiler errors and
warnings. The same holds for React development.

Useful extensions:
- `ESlint` provides support for lint errors and warnings;
- `ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets` provides boilerplate snippets;

# Sandboxing

It is possible to add visual tests and playgrounds inside `src/sandbox` directory.
Please read the associated [src/sandbox/README.md](src/sandbox/README.md) instructions.

# Coding rules

Coding rules are mostly enforced by Eslint. It is mostly composed of all
recommended rules for typescript and React. A few of them are slightly weakened.
Additionally, a small set of rules have been added, divided in two categories.

1. *Safety rules*. These rules aim at avoiding errors by detecting common
mistakes early. Most of these rules have been added after finding a bug that
could have been avoided with this particular rule.
2. *Style rules*. These rules focus on code readability, including making things
explicit or ensuring uniformity. They should not be very constraining.

In some cases, trying to apply rules strictly might be counterproductive. It is
possible to deactivate rules locally with one of the following syntaxes.

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-console */
console.log('test');
/* eslint-enable no-console */
```

```javascript
console.log('test'); // eslint-disable-line no-console
```

```javascript
// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
console.log('test');
```

## Safety rules

- [semi](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi).
  Requires semicolon at the end of statements to avoid unexpected automatic
  semicolon insertion.
- [react-hooks/exhaustive-deps](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#eslint-plugin).
  Detect missing dependencies in hooks.
- [@typescript-eslint/restrict-plus-operands](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/restrict-plus-operands.md).
  Forbids additions other than the addition of two numbers or the addition of
  two strings. In other cases, implicit conversion might have unexpected
  results. To conform to this rule, it might be necessary to use explicit
  conversions or *template literals* (e.g. `` `NÂ°${i}` ``).
- [eqeqeq](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/eqeqeq). Forces the use of `===`
  instead of `==`. The latter often leads to unexpected comparisons in presence
  of `undefined`, `null`, `false`, etc.
- [@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-unused-vars.md).
  Forbids local variables and parameters which are declared but unused. It often
  hides an error. Variables starting with `_` are ignored.
- [no-var](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var).
  Forces the usage of `let` or `const` instead of `var`, potentially avoiding
  scoping errors.
- [@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-explicit-any.md).
  Makes typing mandatory. `any` allows conversions from and into any type,
  effectively disabling the type checker. `unknown` type can often be used
  instead, but with the obligation to verify the actual type at runtime or
  to use explicit unchecked conversions with `as`.

## Style rules

- [max-len](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-len).
  Limit the lines to 80 columns, not including comments.
- [camelcase](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/camelcase).
  Variable names uniformly use camelcase.
- [@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/explicit-function-return-type.md).
  Function return type must always be given. This often helps understanding
  the code. The rule is disabled for function expressions which can stay
  concise.
- [lines-between-class-members](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/lines-between-class-members).
  Forces empty lines between class members, except for single line declarations
  (e.g. properties).
- [object-curly-newline](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-curly-newline).
  Unify curly braces positions.
- [no-constant-condition](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-constant-condition).
  Forbids constant conditions which are often used during the debug process but
  should not remain in release versions. While recommended in Eslint, this
  rule is weakened to allow infinite loops which make sense in Ivette.
- [prefer-const](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const).
  Whenever possible, prefer `const`. Systematic use of `const` makes mutations
  easier to spot and may help to identify problems early.
- [no-console](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-console).
  Forbids the use of `console.*` to prevent remaining debug outputs in code
  releases. For error printing in the console, the use of Dome.Debug is
  encouraged.
